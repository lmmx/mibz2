//! Phases 3 and 4: the inverse BWT. The T-vector (lbzip2's packing: a row's byte in bits
//! 0-7, the next row above) is built by a counting sort, then walked from the primary
//! index. The walk is a chain of dependent loads through 3.6 MB, so it is bound by the
//! load's latency, not by bandwidth (docs/journal/2026-10-27-compute-frontier.md, section
//! 2). `walk_segments` walks it as K chains at once (memory-level parallelism within one
//! block) and joins them: exactly the plain walk's output, in about half its time.
//!
//! Interleaving several traversals of one inversion on one thread, so that out-of-order
//! execution keeps their loads in flight at once, is not new: Kärkkäinen, Kempa and
//! Puglisi, "Slashing the Time for BWT Inversion", DCC 2012, pp. 99-108, do it, and add
//! a super-alphabet (an LF^2 table: two characters a dependent lookup) and "Precopy" for
//! repetitive data. What is particular here is only how the traversals are found in an
//! existing bzip2 file, which carries no metadata for it: pseudo-random rows as segment
//! starts, a bitmap of them to stop each segment, and the segments joined in order.
//!
//! The kernels sit behind `InverseBwt` (a block's last column in, its RLE1-coded text
//! out), so another (an LF^2 walk: a pair table, with a flag for an intermediate row that
//! is a segment start) can be put in without touching the stream, CRC or thread code.
