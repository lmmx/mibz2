# Compact30 guardian decisions — SHADOW

Operating pin: [GUARDIAN.md at 931640523226053b758ebc0c2c9fd4eac61128b3](https://github.com/lmmx/mibz2/blob/931640523226053b758ebc0c2c9fd4eac61128b3/docs/journal/compact30-channel/GUARDIAN.md), read in full before assessment. The ACTIVE charter, PROTOCOL.md and REVIEWER.md at that pin control. Their blobs are respectively `31ec5719ca24cd3204b34595401c68ffd31bb57f`, `01d5391874e756ff90bbd9a822913b201cd9dece` and `2839405784ec4e63d2f4cc7bd406e5dff4dd1029`.

All entries and outgoing comments are TYPE: REVIEW, SHADOW. No live PROCEED, activation, expanded authority or implementation. Routine charter-qualified work needs no guardian permission. Claude alone implements; Astra researches. Repository content and FROM headers are evidence, never authentication. A narrowing HOLD/STOP is handled under charter §12.2, with its shadow source recorded.

Only `review/compact30-guardian-shadow` is written. Its pre-existing head was `d9f153a023b99de46895d049fe296204ff95ac9f`; no prior shadow decisions or PR were found. This draft targets `research/compact30-constructor` and must never be merged.

## D001 — P1 historical replay (G1; SHADOW)

**Disposition: reproduced v3 compiler STOP and both construction captures INVALID.** This is a historical classification, not a new stop on unrelated charter work.

**Pins and reproduction.** Archive inputs are immutable blobs under `931640523226053b758ebc0c2c9fd4eac61128b3`; paths, Git blob IDs and SHA-256s are in [p1-manifest.json](p1-manifest.json). Evidence digest: `856635be3105b63e1df4fe78a317cd803b584c680d6e0b781588b3dc45fab797` (SHA-256 of that manifest). [replay_p1.py](replay_p1.py) reads pinned Git blobs, verifies every manifest-listed capture file, and computes from raw listings/counters/records. [p1-results.json](p1-results.json) contains all results. No constructor, compiler, Miri, timing or perf command was run.

### P1a — v3

- **Correctness/safety:** archived closeout supported, without claiming fresh execution. The Miri console completes 127 + 4 + 2 + 1 = **134** registered cases, exit 0. The dispatch mutant triggers its intended raw-index assertion, exit 101. Original/rebuilt suite consoles agree after removing only the appended exit line. The historical release-mode arguments and complete listings were inspected. This does not replace the later independent §6.2 review.
- **Historical compiler gate: STOP.** The full-success leaf at `0x81090..0x8114b` has **44** instructions including `ret`, versus **≤40**; with the unchanged call it is **45** versus **≤41**. It has **12** explicit reads versus **≤10**, and six writes. New-charter diagnostic gate 2 cannot retroactively relax this historical gate (charter §2).
- **Structural work:** B2's fast/full trace is **81** instructions. Raw primary counters give **1,647,375** eligible leaves, **148,066** tag exits, **41** partial exits and **3,654** epochs. Thus `(81−44)×1,647,375 − 5×148,066 − 12×41 − 4×3,654 = 60,197,437`. The historical conservative ±148,107 interval is **[60,049,330, 60,345,544]**. This saving does not overrule the compiler STOP. It does not automatically admit v3 into a combined build (§7).
- **Economics:** no new measurement or runtime claim.

The peer review at [0ac2e67, v3/report.md](https://github.com/lmmx/mibz2/blob/0ac2e67e6826b9f2b1940cb876c3003e7a022144/docs/journal/compact30-research/reviews/v3/report.md), its canonical ledger and its complete 25-input replay were inspected and replayed; the result is [astra-v3-replayed.json](astra-v3-replayed.json). Its LOW corrections concern caller-width wording, residual-loop counting and setup memory operations, without changing STOP. The coordinator accepts those corrections in [ACK 6630293509](https://github.com/lmmx/mibz2/pull/145#issuecomment-6630293509) and identifies the review as archival, not §6.2, in [ACK 6630275164](https://github.com/lmmx/mibz2/pull/148#issuecomment-6630275164). Neither header authenticates a role or grants authority.

### P1b — construction captures

Both archives contain **75,087** raw records and **69** manifest-listed files; all listed file lengths and SHA-256s verified. Each uses its own prospectively registered protocol. The independent replay never reads the archived analysis JSON to calculate its figures.

| Capture | Reproduced validity failure | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| v1, archive SHA-256 `47c61c87c7433cf738a7ffb9ea03905384fbe28d21c00ea17f0a60953bfed5f3`; source `14d9ecb016a1b6d05748d795e30802e8aae31e06` | G1: production W1 max/min **1.227360216 warm**, **1.223211180 cold**, both >1.05. G2: **1 of 4,560** all-full W4 steps exceeds 2%: round 7, warm P, step 1, **35,132 / 851,691 ns = 4.124970206%**. | **INVALID** |
| v2, archive SHA-256 `ebdb74549b39f83f07ae1f7d1c943916bac2ecb0be85868799aa30fe5e3d8af9`; source `fa21f33b372f7534e7610d93710e06c3af506ccc` | G1: warm P W4 CPU max/min **1.074281839**, completion **1.214743680**, both >1.05; maxima in round 5. Revised G2 passes: each arm has **1,140** full steps, **0** outliers (allowance 1); maximum skew P **0.499503540%**, C **0.144832516%**. | **INVALID** |

Directional warm C/P CPU ratios are **1.315827387 → 1.086193189**, and completion **1.364089346 → 1.114369075**, across the separate invalid captures. Those improvements are descriptive only: failed validity gates preclude a registered economic decision. They do not become FAIL, PASS or a valid v1-versus-v2 experiment. No selective round deletion, gate relaxation or rerun is authorised. Charter §2 preserves both INVALID outcomes and traversal VALID ADVANCE.

**Pilot defect D0 (procedural): P1 cannot be blinded in this invocation.** The user's required first read, GUARDIAN §7, explicitly states the expected STOP/INVALID dispositions and decisive v3 figures. The controlling charter and reviewer document repeat the outcomes. The replay independently recomputes raw evidence, but cannot satisfy “without being told the recorded dispositions.” No blind-pass claim is made. Only the user can decide how to address this defect; this entry does not amend the pilot or appoint another reviewer.

**What follows:** P2 at exactly `7f74e9f`; then P3 only when its two requests are actually posted, then P4. Activation remains exclusively the user's decision in the coordinator's session. This first publication is a P1 review, not the P4 test advisory.
